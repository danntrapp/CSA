4. Consider the following code segment, which is intended to find the average of two positive integers, x and y.

int x;
int y;
int sum = x + y;
double average = (double) (sum / 2);

Which of the following best describes the error, if any, in the code segment?

(A) There is no error, and the code works as intended.
(B) In the expression (double) (sum / 2), the cast to double is applied too late, so the average will
be less than the expected result for even values of sum.
(C) In the expression (double) (sum / 2), the cast to double is applied too late, so the average will
be greater than the expected result for even values of sum.
(D) In the expression (double) (sum / 2), the cast to double is applied too late, so the average will
be less than the expected result for odd values of sum.
(E) In the expression (double) (sum / 2), the cast to double is applied too late, so the average will
be greater than the expected result for odd values of sum.
